#digital-ocean-3

This project contains everything needed to build ciwise-3 using Terraform except for the tf_variables 
file containing security information. A tf_vars template file is included without values for reference.

This plan also creates, ciwise-4, a 512mb Debian 8 instance that will be used to test Ansible's provisioning.
